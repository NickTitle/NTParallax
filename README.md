---------------------------

Add custom parallax to your apps in just a few small steps:

1. Add CoreMotion to your project
2. Import```NTParallaxStackController.h``` to your target view controller's header
3. Create an ```NTParallaxStackController``` as a property
4. Instantiate the ```NTParallaxStackController```
5. Add the ```NTParallaxStackController``` to your target view controller
6. Add ```NTParallaxLayer```s to the ```NTParallaxStackController```

- You can have as many ```NTParallaxStackController```s as you want.
- Each ```NTParallaxStackController``` can have as many ```NTParallaxLayer```s as you need.
