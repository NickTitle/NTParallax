===================

[Watch the demo on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLxkZNEoN-o)
---------------------------
Add custom parallax to your apps in just a few small steps:

1. Add CoreMotion to your project
2. Import "NTParallaxStackController.h" to your view controller's header
3. Create an NTParallaxStackController as a property
4. Instantiate the NTParallaxStackController
5. Add NTParallaxLayers to the Stack
6. Add the NTParallaxStackController to your view controller hierarchy

- You can have as many NTParallaxStackControllers as you want.
- Each NTParallaxStackController can have as many NTParallaxLayers as you need.

Note:This is fully functional code, but not optimized yet. Feel free to use now, but watch the repo for updates in the near future.
